2: Log all variables to the console, for example:

Title: The Lord of the Javascript
Author: Mario

Sales: 120

- Increase the number of sales.
- Update the book's rating.

3: The logging code above is repetitive and hard to maintain.
   Refactor your code by doing the following:

 - Write a function called `logBookData` that logs all the book details to the console.
 - Replace the existing `console.log` statements with calls to this function.
 - Then, increase the number of sales two more times and log the updated details after each increase.
