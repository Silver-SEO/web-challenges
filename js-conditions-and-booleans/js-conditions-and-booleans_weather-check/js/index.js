/*
- Write a `switch` statement that checks the value of `weather` and logs a message for each weather condition.
  - Example:
  - If the weather is "sunny" â†’ "It's sunny!"
  - If the weather is "rainy" â†’ "It's raining, don't forget your umbrella!"
  - If the weather is "snowy" â†’ "It's snowing, stay warm!"
  - For any other input â†’ "I'm not sure what the weather is like."
> ğŸ’¡ Tip: Use the `break` statement to avoid the "fall-through" effect.
